Rapid Technical Acquisition Specialist | Platform Engineer

My GitHub is a living portfolio of my proficiency in modern infrastructure. I specialize in the accelerated design and implementation of cloud-native systems, with a proven ability to go from zero knowledge to enterprise-level proficiency in weeks, not months.

Core Competencies:

Cloud-Native Architecture: Kubernetes, Istio, Docker, GCP, Go

Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, Ansible, GitOps

Systems & Operations: Linux, Networking, Bare Metal, Prometheus, Grafana, Cilium, Rook, YAML

I believe systematic problem-solving and production-grade documentation are cornerstones of a scalable environment. Every project here is a testament to my methodical approach and a record of real-world troubleshooting.

Seeking organizations that value technical depth and learning velocity.
